# battleship

This web-based Battleship project is the capstone project for the Odin Project's Javascript course, meant to showcase understanding of Javascript logic, test-driven development, DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming. 

Players take turns against a computer opponent, placing their own ships and guessing locations to attack while the computer does the same.

The languages and technologies I used for this project were: 
    Javascript
    HTML5
    CSS
    Webpack
    Jest
